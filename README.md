The goal of this project is to learn and practice frontend development skills by building a **Pomodoro Timer**, a productivity tool based on the Pomodoro Technique. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break work into intervals (typically 25 minutes) separated by short breaks.

## Requirements

You will create a Pomodoro Timer web application using the frontend framework of your choice e.g. React, Vue or Angular. Here is the list of requirements for the application:

- User should be able to start stop and resume a pomodoro timer.
- User should be able to configure the default interval configuration; default work session should be 25 minutes, short break should be 5 minutes and longer break after 4 work sessions should be 15 minutes.
- Application should display the current session type (e.g., Work, Short Break, Long Break).
- It should also track the number of tracked work sessions
- Play a sound when a session ends to notify the user.
- Ensure the app is accessible and visually appealing on both desktop and mobile devices.

You can use any existing pomodoro apps for the UI inspiration e.g.

- [time.fyi - Pomodoro Timer](https://time.fyi/pomodoro)
- [Pomofocus - Pomodoro Tracker](https://pomofocus.io/)

## Technical Requirements

- Use **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** (or a frontend framework/library such as React, Vue, or Angular).
- Implement state management for the timer and session tracking.
- Use a modular and reusable code structure.
- Maintain proper accessibility standards (e.g., keyboard navigation, ARIA labels).

Feel free to deploy the application on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) or [Cloudflare pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/)
